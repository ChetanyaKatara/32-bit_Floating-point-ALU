# 32-bit_Floating-point-ALU
Hello everyone, I am Chetanya Katara, a Pre-final year student at Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology. Here I am presenting you my project which is a 
32-bit Arithmetic Logical Unit which can perform :-

1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
   
The inputs to the ALU are 32-bit Single precision floating point numbers based on IEEE 754 convention.

Hope you like it.
